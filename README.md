# EdgieD Library v1.0
### Crunchysteve, &copy;2022.

Based on the button edge detection tutorial at...
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/StateChangeDetection
but generalised for working with variables and other coded binary state
changes. It can read digital inputs to detect a button state change, 
the output state of a timer or the output states of other custom libraries.

The included example detects the "leading edge" (as pressed) of a button, attached
between pin 2 and ground, not changing output state again until released, then pressed again.

The EdgieD Library is free software, please see "licence.txt" in the enclosing folder.
